BUGZILLA CACLULATED PRIORITY EXTENSION
--------------------------------------

This extension has no user interface; it is a hard-coded implementation
of a calculated value scheme for bugzilla.  It expects the following
custom fields to be defined:

cf_impact: (I)

Blocker - Problems that prevent testing or development work
High - Problems causing crashes, data loss, severe performance problems
Normal - Broken or missing functionality
Low - Improvement to existing code, e.g. performance enhancement
Enhancement - New features

cf_probability: (P)

Seen by all or almost all users who use the feature (>=95% of users)
Seen by more than 2/3 of the users who use the feature (>66% and <95%)
Seen by about half the users who use the feature (>33% and <67%)
Seen by about 1/3 of the users who use the feature (>5% and <34%)
Seen by no or very few users who use the feature (<=5% of users)

cf_defectclass: (D)

Stability - Reliability; Availability; Testability; Security; Liability; Storage (data loss/corruption);
Performance - Efficiency (use of resources: memory, disk, CPU); Scalability; Copyright
Functionality - Logic or Calculation; Access Control; Compatibility; Interoperability
Usability - Learnability; Readability; Documentation; Consistency; Workflow
Typographic or grammatical - Aesthetics; Appearance or Cosmetic

cf_workeffort: (W)

Extensive analysis needed - > 1 week
Above average analysis needed - < 1 week
Normal analysis needed - < 3 days
Minimal analysis needed - < 1 day
No substantial analysis  needed - < 4 hours

These custom fields must be entered into bugzilla via its UI.  Once
these fields are available, this extension will automatically
calculate the bug_severity and priority (the two fields labeled
"Importance" in the UI) based on the following criteria.

bug_severity:

1 - (I*P*D) ==  0
2 - (I*P*D) ==  1 - 4
3 - (I*P*D) ==  6 - 12
4 - (I*P*D) == 27 - 36
5 - (I*P*D) >= 37

The effect of this is that any of I, P or D are zero, then the severity
will always be 1, and all of I, P and D must be large before the severity
evaluates to 4 or 5.  If any of I, P or D are unset, then the bug_severity
field can be set to any value from 1 - 5; otherwise, it will be forced
to the value indicated by the calculation above.

The resulting severity value feeds into the bug priority calculation; it
is used together with the cf_workeffort field as an index into the
two-dimensional priority lookup table:


priority:

            :    Work Effort
            :
            : 1   2   3   4   5
------------+---+---+---+---+---
          1 : *   *   *   1   1
            +
Severity  2 : *   *   *   2   2
            +
          3 : *   *   *   3   2
  Level     +
          4 : 5   4   4   4   3
            +
          5 : 5   5   4   4   3


If the work effort is unset, or if the lookup table results in a "*",
then the bug priority can be set to any value from 1 - 5; otherwise, it
will be forced to the value indicated in the table.

These rules can be changed by modifying the template that defines the
lookup tables and field names; see:
